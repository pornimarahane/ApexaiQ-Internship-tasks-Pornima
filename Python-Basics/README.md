PYTHON BASICS:

This repository contains simple Python programs to  understand some basic and important concepts in Python. Each file demonstrates a concept with  working code.

Requirements to run Python files:
1. Python Installed on your PC.
2. A code editor(VS code, PyCharm).


To run a Python file:  
1. Open command prompt/Terminal.
2. Navigate to folder containing the file.
3. Run the file using(command: python filename.py).


Dict Comprehension:  
Dictionary comprehension  is used to create dictionaries in a single line.  
Purpose:
1. Makes dictionary creation more concise.
2. Can include conditions to filter items.  
Syntax:
{key_expr: value_expr for item in iterable if condition}

Error Handling:  
Error handling in Python allows your program to handle unexpected situations called as exceptions properly instead of halting the program execution.  
Purpose:
1. Handle different types of errors.
2. Use try, except, else, and finally to manage errors.

File Handling:  
File handling in Python allows you to create, read, update, and delete files directly from your programs.  
Purpose:
1. Store and retrieve data.
2. Automate reading/writing tasks

Modes: 
1. 'r' → Read (file must exist)
2. 'w' → Write (creates or overwrites file)
3. 'a' → Append (adds to end of file)

List Comprehension:  
List comprehension is a  way to create lists in Python. Instead of writing long loops to fill a list, you can write it in a single line.  
Purpose:
1. Makes code cleaner and shorter
2. Often faster than traditional loops
Syntax:
variable_name = [expression for item in iterable]

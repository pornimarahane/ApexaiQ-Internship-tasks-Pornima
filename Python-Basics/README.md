# My Python Project

This is my first Python project on GitHub.  
Iâ€™m just starting, so this is a simple example for now.  
I will update it as I learn more and add new features.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

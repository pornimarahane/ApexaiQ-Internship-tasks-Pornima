What is web Scraping?  
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. Instead of manually copying information from web pages, web scraping uses scripts or tools to collect data in a structured format, such as tables, lists, or text files. This helps in saving time, reducing errors, and handling large volumes of data efficiently.

Requirements for web scraping:  
Selenium  
Web Driver  
VS Code

Steps to perform to run this files:  
1. Install selenium in VS code.  
   Command: pip install selenium

2. Install a compatible driver for your browser.  
   Ex. If Chrome (Version 139.0.7258.128), then the chromedriver has  
   version(139.x.xxxx.xxx).

3. Copy the Python file.  
   Note: Chnage the browser-driver's url with your url.

4. You can even add website of your choice to scrap by changing web url, changing Xpath, and defining proper regex.
